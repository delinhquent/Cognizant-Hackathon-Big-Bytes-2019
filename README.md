# Fraud Analysis using Logistic Regression
This model was built for Cognizant's Big Byte Hackathon during 2019. It is to help a global credit card company to detect fraudulent transaction. I have created a model based on Logistic Regression.


The dataset can be found here under 'Business Case Data Set': http://bigbytes.sg/the-mission/

This is my first time trying to build a Machine Learning Model and have learnt many things on it such as doing cross-validations, undersampling, oversampling, interpreting descriptive data. I decided to use Logistic Regression as it was easy to understand but I think that there are better models which can be used to detect fraudulant transactions better such as Neural Network. In my opinion, Logistic Regression is not easily customizable to improve towards a certain metrics such as F1 score and Recall score. However, this is still a fun and interesting experience for me.
